# OSAC Ansible Project

This repository contains the Ansible automation layer for
[OSAC (Open Sovereign AI Cloud)](https://github.com/osac-project).
It provides the playbooks, roles, and collections that provision and manage
infrastructure resources — networking, compute, bare-metal hosts, and
OpenShift clusters — when triggered by the
[osac-operator](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator) via
Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).

## How it fits into OSAC

OSAC is composed of three main components:

```
User ─► fulfillment-service (API) ─► osac-operator (watches K8s CRs) ─► AAP ─► osac-aap (this repo)
```

1. **[fulfillment-service](https://github.com/osac-project/fulfillment-service)** —
   The backend API that users interact with. It exposes available resource types
   (NetworkClasses, ComputeClasses, ClusterTemplates) that are auto-discovered
   from this repo.
2. **[osac-operator](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator)** —
   A Kubernetes operator that watches Custom Resources (VirtualNetwork, Subnet,
   SecurityGroup, ComputeInstance, ClusterOrder, etc.) and triggers AAP job
   templates to provision them.
3. **osac-aap (this repo)** — The Ansible automation that actually creates
   infrastructure. Each playbook receives the full K8s CR as its payload,
   reads an `implementation_strategy` annotation, and dynamically includes the
   matching template role to do the provisioning.

## What it provisions

### Networking

Playbooks for the full VirtualNetwork → Subnet → SecurityGroup lifecycle, with
pluggable backends:

| Implementation | Role | Backend |
|----------------|------|---------|
| `cudn_net` | ClusterUserDefinedNetwork (CUDN) on OpenShift | OVN-Kubernetes |
| `netris` | Netris Controller API | Netris |
| `agentless_net` | UID-keyed VirtualNetwork namespace, transit uplink, and forwarding baseline | AgentlessNet |
| `openstack` | OpenStack Neutron | Neutron |

The `agentless_net` role provisions and removes VirtualNetwork namespaces and
their transit uplinks. Subnet, SecurityGroup, ExternalIPPool, ExternalIP, and
NATGateway operations still fail fast. The unified Networking API stores its
schema-v2 VirtualNetwork state at `AGENTLESS_NET_STATE_FILE` on the network
node; the older `AGENTLESS_NET_IPAM_STATE_FILE` remains separate for the
existing CaaS step workflows. The provider inventory supplies
`transit_cidr_pool` and `external_interface` values, or they can be configured
through `AGENTLESS_NET_TRANSIT_CIDR_POOL` and
`AGENTLESS_NET_EXTERNAL_INTERFACE`.

Plus MetalLB-based ExternalIPPool / ExternalIP management (`metallb_l2`).

### Compute

- **`ocp_virt_vm`** — Provisions virtual machines on OpenShift Virtualization
  (KubeVirt), with configurable CPU, memory, storage, and network attachments.

### Bare Metal

- **`bm_host_agent_provisioning` / `bm_host_agent_deprovisioning`** — Agent-based
  bare-metal host lifecycle.
- **`bm_private_network` / `bm_host_private_network`** — Private network
  attachment for bare-metal hosts.
- Host lease management and bare-metal provisioning integrations.

### Clusters

- **`ocp_small`**, **`ocp_4_20_ai_maas`**, **`ocp_ci_small`** — OpenShift cluster
  templates with different sizes, authentication methods, and infrastructure
  backends (Netris, agentless_net).
- Multi-step workflow playbooks for hosted cluster create / delete / post-install.

### Local LVMS CSI StorageClasses

Single-node VMaaS development/CI deployments can opt in with
`csi_driver_install_lvms_storage_class_enabled: true`. Tenant Stage 2 creates
`osac-<tenant>-<tier>` using the OSAC CSI provisioner. The default remains
`false`, preserving direct TopoLVM classes; ClusterOrder/CaaS stays on its
legacy storage path.

The selector does not migrate existing classes or volumes. If a same-name
class already exists with incompatible provisioner, parameters, reclaim policy
or binding mode, the role fails before modifying any local classes and explains
the prerequisite. Kubernetes makes these fields immutable. For an existing
development installation, check its PVC/PV dependencies and explicitly remove
and recreate the class before opting in, or keep the legacy selector setting.
The role never deletes a class automatically; existing compatible CSI classes
remain idempotent.

```

### Key design pattern

Every template role declares its capabilities in `meta/osac.yaml`. Network
roles identify themselves via `fabric_manager`/`k8s_manager` (the dispatcher's
routing keys); other template types still use `implementation_strategy`:

```yaml
template_type: network
fabric_manager: cudn_net
capabilities:
  supports_ipv4: true
  supports_ipv6: true
  supports_dual_stack: true
```

Network roles declare their dispatcher identity for the operator. The installer
owns NetworkClass creation; `agentless_net` is selected through the installer
[overlay instructions](../osac-installer/docs/helm-deployment-guide.md#agentlessnet-resource-operation-stub)
and is not published as a ComputeClass. The generic
resource playbooks then include the selected role without changing the API.

## Pre-requisites

This project uses uv to install Ansible and other Python dependencies.

Install all the necessary dependencies by running:

```
uv sync --all-groups
```

Then you can run commands like this:

```
uv run ansible-playbook ...
```

Or you can activate the virtual environment so all commands are in your `$PATH` by default:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Re-vendor Ansible collections

This repository explicitly vendors the Ansible collections that are used as
dependencies, they are located in `vendor/` directory. You'll need
to re-vendor them after an update of `collections/requirements.yaml`.

First set your environment in order to be able to pull some of the collections
available only in Red Hat Automation Hub:

```
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_LIST=automation_hub,default
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_URL=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/published/
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_AUTH_URL=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_DEFAULT_URL=https://galaxy.ansible.com/
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN=<Get your token from https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token>
```

Then re-vendor the collections:

```
rm -rf vendor
ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml
```
