# OSAC Ansible Project

This repository contains the Ansible automation layer for
[OSAC (Open Sovereign AI Cloud)](https://github.com/osac-project).
It provides the playbooks, roles, and collections that provision and manage
infrastructure resources — networking, compute, bare-metal hosts, and
OpenShift clusters — when triggered by the
[osac-operator](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator) via
Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).

## How it fits into OSAC

OSAC is composed of three main components:

```
User ─► fulfillment-service (API) ─► osac-operator (watches K8s CRs) ─► AAP ─► osac-aap (this repo)
```

1. **[fulfillment-service](https://github.com/osac-project/fulfillment-service)** —
   The backend API that users interact with. It exposes available resource types
   (NetworkClasses, ComputeClasses, ClusterTemplates) that are auto-discovered
   from this repo.
2. **[osac-operator](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-operator)** —
   A Kubernetes operator that watches Custom Resources (VirtualNetwork, Subnet,
   SecurityGroup, ComputeInstance, ClusterOrder, etc.) and triggers AAP job
   templates to provision them.
3. **osac-aap (this repo)** — The Ansible automation that actually creates
   infrastructure. Each playbook receives the full K8s CR as its payload,
   reads an `implementation_strategy` annotation, and dynamically includes the
   matching template role to do the provisioning.

## What it provisions

### Networking

Playbooks for the full VirtualNetwork → Subnet → SecurityGroup lifecycle, with
pluggable backends:

| Implementation | Role | Backend |
|----------------|------|---------|
| `cudn_net` | ClusterUserDefinedNetwork (CUDN) on OpenShift | OVN-Kubernetes |
| `netris` | Netris Controller API | Netris |
| `agentless_net` | UID-keyed VirtualNetwork namespace, transit uplink, and forwarding baseline | AgentlessNet |
| `openstack` | OpenStack Neutron | Neutron |

The current `agentless_net` unified-resource path provisions and removes the
VirtualNetwork namespace, transit uplink, and forwarding baseline. Subnet,
SecurityGroup, ExternalIPPool, ExternalIP, ExternalIPAttachment, and NATGateway
operations still fail fast. A successful VirtualNetwork means this namespace
baseline was verified; it does not mean that tenant traffic has external
reachability.

VirtualNetwork provider state uses schema v1 at
`AGENTLESS_NET_STATE_FILE` (default `/etc/osac/agentless_network_state.json`).
This is the first deployed format, so unsupported versions fail closed rather
than migrating. The state file stores the immutable VirtualNetwork CR CIDR and
one UID-keyed `/31` transit link carved from that CIDR. Both addresses are
endpoints: the host uses the base address and acts as the namespace default
gateway; the namespace uses the next address. The `/31` link reserves no
network or broadcast address and is not an OSAC Subnet. A future Subnet
allocator must exclude this transit block.

The state-file flock is held only while reading, allocating, or committing the
atomic JSON snapshot and backup. A second lock serializes operations for the
same resource UID while provider commands run; a short firewall lock protects
the shared host `FORWARD` rules. Failed creates retain their allocation for
retry. Deletes retain the entry until the UID-owned namespace, uplink, and host
isolation rules have been removed and verified. The module rejects a missing
state file when a backup exists, malformed JSON, unsupported versions, and
unsafe owner or file modes; do not delete the state file or backup to clear an
error.

Each selected AgentlessNet VirtualNetwork job requires the optional
`agentless-net-inventory` ConfigMap mounted at
`/var/config/agentless-net/inventory.yml`. It must describe exactly one
authoritative host under `all.children.net_nodes.hosts`, with `ansible_host`
and `ansible_user`, plus an optional numeric `ansible_port` (default `22`). Do
not put password fields anywhere in the ConfigMap. Configure SSH
with an AAP machine credential or the `AGENTLESS_NET_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` value
from the `network-fulfillment-ig` Secret. When the Secret key is used, the role
writes it to a mode-0600 temporary file on the AAP worker and removes that file
after the provider operation.
The ConfigMap mount remains optional so unrelated AAP jobs can start; an
AgentlessNet VirtualNetwork job fails before mutation when the file, host, or
connection data is missing or invalid.

The managed node must be reachable by SSH and provide Python 3, `iproute2`,
`iptables` with conntrack support, and privilege escalation. The role enables
IPv4 forwarding and a permit-all `FORWARD` policy inside the namespace. It
does not change the host forwarding sysctl; interface-scoped host drops keep
traffic isolated between VirtualNetworks. BGP, Subnet/VLAN/DHCP, NAT, and full
external connectivity remain separate work.

The older `AGENTLESS_NET_IPAM_STATE_FILE` and
`AGENTLESS_NET_EXTERNAL_INTERFACE` settings remain separate for embedded CaaS
step workflows; they do not configure VirtualNetwork transit links.

Plus MetalLB-based ExternalIPPool / ExternalIP management (`metallb_l2`).

### Compute

- **`ocp_virt_vm`** — Provisions virtual machines on OpenShift Virtualization
  (KubeVirt), with configurable CPU, memory, storage, and network attachments.

### Bare Metal

- **`bm_host_agent_provisioning` / `bm_host_agent_deprovisioning`** — Agent-based
  bare-metal host lifecycle.
- **`bm_private_network` / `bm_host_private_network`** — Private network
  attachment for bare-metal hosts.
- Host lease management and bare-metal provisioning integrations.

### Clusters

- **`ocp_small`**, **`ocp_4_20_ai_maas`**, **`ocp_ci_small`** — OpenShift cluster
  templates with different sizes, authentication methods, and infrastructure
  backends (Netris, agentless_net).
- Multi-step workflow playbooks for hosted cluster create / delete / post-install.

### Local LVMS CSI StorageClasses

Single-node VMaaS development/CI deployments can opt in with
`csi_driver_install_lvms_storage_class_enabled: true`. Tenant Stage 2 creates
`osac-<tenant>-<tier>` using the OSAC CSI provisioner. The default remains
`false`, preserving direct TopoLVM classes; ClusterOrder/CaaS stays on its
legacy storage path.

The selector does not migrate existing classes or volumes. If a same-name
class already exists with incompatible provisioner, parameters, reclaim policy
or binding mode, the role fails before modifying any local classes and explains
the prerequisite. Kubernetes makes these fields immutable. For an existing
development installation, check its PVC/PV dependencies and explicitly remove
and recreate the class before opting in, or keep the legacy selector setting.
The role never deletes a class automatically; existing compatible CSI classes
remain idempotent.

```

### Key design pattern

Every template role declares its capabilities in `meta/osac.yaml`. Network
roles identify themselves via `fabric_manager`/`k8s_manager` (the dispatcher's
routing keys); other template types still use `implementation_strategy`:

```yaml
template_type: network
fabric_manager: cudn_net
capabilities:
  supports_ipv4: true
  supports_ipv6: true
  supports_dual_stack: true
```

Network roles declare their dispatcher identity for the operator. The installer
owns NetworkClass creation; `agentless_net` is selected through the installer
[overlay instructions](../osac-installer/docs/network-backend.md#agentlessnet-virtualnetwork-baseline)
and is not published as a ComputeClass. The generic
resource playbooks then include the selected role without changing the API.

## Pre-requisites

This project uses uv to install Ansible and other Python dependencies.

Install all the necessary dependencies by running:

```
uv sync --all-groups
```

Then you can run commands like this:

```
uv run ansible-playbook ...
```

Or you can activate the virtual environment so all commands are in your `$PATH` by default:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Re-vendor Ansible collections

This repository explicitly vendors the Ansible collections that are used as
dependencies, they are located in `vendor/` directory. You'll need
to re-vendor them after an update of `collections/requirements.yaml`.

First set your environment in order to be able to pull some of the collections
available only in Red Hat Automation Hub:

```
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_LIST=automation_hub,default
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_URL=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/published/
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_AUTH_URL=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_DEFAULT_URL=https://galaxy.ansible.com/
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN=<Get your token from https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token>
```

Then re-vendor the collections:

```
rm -rf vendor
ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml
```
